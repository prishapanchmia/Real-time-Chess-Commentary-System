# Real-time-Chess-Commentary-System

Leveraging Generative Models for Real-Time Chess Commentary:
This project explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and the game of chess.  Our goal was to develop a system that can provide insightful and engaging real-time commentary for chess games, similar to what a human commentator would offer. We've combined generative models, a knowledge graph, and advanced NLP techniques to create an intelligent system that analyzes chess moves, retrieves relevant data, and generates context-aware commentary. This project aims to enhance the experience of chess enthusiasts of all skill levels, providing a deeper understanding of the game's complexities.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Analysis:** Provides move-by-move commentary as a chess game progresses.
*   **Context-Aware Commentary:** Generates commentary that considers the current game state, historical moves, and strategic implications.
*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Utilizes a knowledge graph to capture dynamic and strategic relationships between pieces and positions.
*   **Generative Model-Powered:**  Leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate human-like and informative commentary.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Employs a RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant information and enhance the quality of the commentary.
*   **Scalable Dataset:** Trained on a large dataset of annotated chess games and commentary.
